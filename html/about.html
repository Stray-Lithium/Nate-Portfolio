    <h2><span>About me</span></h2>
    <p>
      I'm Nate, I have recently made a move to Iceland and have been settled into a
      software role for some time now. I love what I do and am still always looking
      into new things I can learn and new projects I can get involved in.
      I feel like my journey is still just beginning and I want to see how far I can take this.
      <br />
      <br />
      It all started for me when I graduated from Northcoders which is a fullstack
      software development bootcamp. The 10 years previously for me employment wise
      have been customer facing roles; all the way from weddings to insurance
      sales and I always struggled with the concept of feeling like I've
      accomplished everything within any given role, when I know the job inside
      out, what is left? This is what prompted the change of career for
      me.<br />
      <br />
      I had a friend recommend that I try programming as its not something I
      will ever be able to 'complete' and will always bring me a challenge, boy
      was he right. Since that conversation I have had the coding bug and I
      haven't been able stop, it excites me and it is amazing how there is just
      no limit to what can be achieved, code is all around us and I want to be a
      part of its future.

    <p>
      Another thing that is a big part of my life is anything creative, I have
      spent countless nights at my computer learning how to do something new
      whether it be learning an instrument, new software or how to make jewellery.
      I like to think this will benefit my coding progression from a visual
      perspective, I have had a lot of exposure to Photoshop along with other
      Adobe software's which means not only can I put all of these once thought
      useless skills to use but it also shows I am able to adapt to new things
      and want to learn them not only because I have to, but because I genuinely
      enjoy it. <br />
      <br />
      Please see my work page to see some of the projects I have completed and
      what techs I have had exposure to, fill in the contact form if you have
      any questions!
